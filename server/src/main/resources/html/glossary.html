            <td class="columna1">Abuser </td>
            <td class="columna2">Pokémon that takes advantage of or abuses some type of strategy in particular, mainly climates or field terrain. For example, Ludicolo is an abuser when playing in the rain, as they double their speed thanks to their Quick Swim ability to deal damage before any other Pokémon. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Back </td>
            <td class="columna2">The two Pokémon that you select for the game, but not as a lead, that is, those that remain in reserve on the first turn of the game. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Bo1 and Bo3 </td>
            <td class="columna2">Abbreviation of best of one or best of three, which means "to the best of 1 or 3". As is evident, it alludes to the number of fights that will decide the winner in a confrontation between two players. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Checking </td>
            <td class="columna2">Pokémon that is capable of finishing another if it attacks before it, but would take considerable damage or go down weakened if it were hit by it. That is, you have to enter a clean turn to kill him. For example, Rotom-Wash checks Tyranitar, as it can knock it out of a withering Water-type attack, but it isn't undamaged if it freely switches into Tyranitar. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Clean shift </td>
            <td class="columna2">The turn in which one or both of your Pokémon enters the field without taking any damage. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Core </td>
            <td class="columna2">Set of Pokémon (usually around 3, although exceptionally there have been 4 or 5) that work well when used in sync. Between them they cover their weaknesses and offer both offensive and defensive power against much of the metagame of the moment, which we usually call synergy. A clear example would be the FWG core, which stands for Fire/Water/Plant in English. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Counter </td>
            <td class="columna2">Pokémon that is capable of finishing off another and that, in addition, this one cannot do great damage to it, because its movements are ineffective against it, or they do not directly affect it. Therefore, you can come in to take a hit from him and later weaken him without any problem.
              A clear example would be Bisharp, which is a direct counter to Dragapult, which is weak to Dark-type attacks and also cannot effectively hit Bisharp with any STAB due to its Steel-type. However, if Dragapult has learned a coverage move like Flamethrower, which is super effective against Bisharp, Bisharp would stop being a counter and instead be a check.

            <td class="columna1">Fast mode </td>
            <td class="columna2">On a team whose predominant strategy is to use slow Pokémon under Trick Room, fast mode is some Pokémon on that same team that work without having activated it. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Flinch </td>
            <td class="columna2">The flinch is the secondary effect of moves like Avalanche or Chuzos, with which your Pokémon is disabled for one turn because it backs up. For example, Landorus uses Avalanche against both of my Pokémon, and one of them flinches back. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Format </td>
            <td class="columna2">VGC events are played under formats, that is, sets of rules and specifications that apply to all tournaments in the same calendar year. Victory Road events are also governed by those same formats. Thus, you will see the formats mentioned as "VGCxx", where xx is the year in which it is maintained as the official format. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Matchup (MU) </td>
            <td class="columna2">Situation that occurs between two teams, where one usually has an advantage over the other. If my team has a lot of Ghost-type Pokémon, and the opponent has a Tyranitar among their ranks, I'll probably have a hard time, which means I have a bad match-up, or an unfavorable match-up. </td>

            <td class="columna1">Metagame </td>
            <td class="columna2">Set of the most used and common Pokémon in a format, usually centralizing it and making all teams include them and/or must be prepared for them. For example, the VGC 2020 metagame consisted of approximately fifty Pokémon, among which Togekiss, Tyranitar, Dragapult, Dusclops, Excadrill or Arcanine stood out. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Mid-game and Late-game </td>
            <td class="columna2">Combat situation that refers to the middle section of its development (midgame, or in the middle of the game, after about 2-3 turns) or towards the end of it (lategame). </td>

            <td class="columna1">Movepool </td>
            <td class="columna2">Range of viable moves (although it can also refer to all, in general) that a Pokémon can learn. </td>

            <td class="columna1">MVP </td>
            <td class="columna2">Acronym in English for Most Valuable Player, the most valuable player (of the team). It refers to the key Pokémon of a team during the different games of an event or competition. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Nerf </td>
            <td class="columna2">It refers to the decrease in power/utility of the game developers regarding an ability, a movement, a Pokémon... In the seventh generation, the accuracy of Thunder Wave was nerfed, from 100% (always hits) to 90% (hits 9 out of 10 times). </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">OHKO, 2HKO, nHKO </td>
            <td class="columna2">Number of times you need to use the same Pokémon or attack to weaken a specific opponent, being OHKO (one-hit knock out) only one, and can be changed by any number n. So if my Excadrill gets a 2HKO on Togekiss, it means he needs two hits to take him down. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Outspeed </td>
            <td class="columna2">This expression refers to when a Pokémon is faster than another.
              For example, Arcanine tends to outspeed Excadrill, as their base speeds are different despite the training they both receive, being 95 on Arcanine and 88 on Excadrill. However, depending on their training, the items they are equipped with, their abilities, the weather, and a host of other factors, Excadrill could outspeed the Arcanine.
            </td>
          </tr>

            <td class="columna1">Ranking Points (CPs) </td>
            <td class="columna2">Qualifying Points (CPs) are accumulated by playing multiple tournaments throughout a season to qualify for that year's World Championship. The point counters are renewed every season for everyone, and you always start from scratch. </td>

            <td class="columna2">Pokémon whose function is to enter a clean turn when one of its companions falls and do considerable damage to those of the opponent in the following turn.

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Roll </td>
            <td class="columna2">Each attack made has different possible damage to the opponent, either in the form of HP (for example, from 120 to 137 HP) or in the form of percentage (for example, 38.6-44.7%). The roll is the two extremes that comprise the range of damage done. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">Season </td>
            <td class="columna2">On the official tournament circuit, a season is the 12-month period between September and August between two years. For example, the 2019 season started in September 2018 and ended in August 2019 with the 2019 World Championship.
              However, within the same season several formats are usually played. In the case of the 2019 season, it was played with the VGC 2019 Ultra Series format from September to December 2019, and from January 2020 onwards with VGC 2020.

            <td class="columna1">Speed control </td>
            <td class="columna2">Pokémon or movement that is in charge of offering some method that allows to control the speed, be it only that of the rival Pokémon, that of our team, or that of the entire field. This is considerably important to achieve optimal positioning in the game. As for moves, Tricky Space, Ice Wind, and Tailwind are the most common; while Pokemon like Cresselia, Tapu Fini, or Zapdos are excellent at controlling speed. </td>

          <tr>
            <td class="columna1">STAB </td>
            <td class="columna2">STAB is an acronym for Same Type Attack Bonus, which refers to the 50% damage bonus when a Pokémon uses moves of the same type. For example, Togekiss using Glow Magic receives an extra 50% on the damage he deals because he is also a Fairy type. This does not happen when the same Pokémon uses another move that does not correspond to its types, such as Fire Wave in Togekiss. </td>
